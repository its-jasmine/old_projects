# old_projects
This repository contains old projects from high school when I was teaching myself python

# 1) CoffeeTimeRenewed

This my first non-trivial project in Python. It is a test-based interactive program that allows you to create a beverage order.
You will be prompted to specify various details about your beverage order. Once you are done, the bill will be shown.
Responses are case sensitive. 

Requires a lot of fine tuning but it was a decent first attempt.

# 2) Calculator

This was my first non-trivial project with a GUI (using tkinter). Learned how to configure widgets on the screen using various frames and gridding.

Good functionality with basic operations. sqrt() does not behave correctly.

# 3) Budget Tracker

Explored some new tkinter widgets and experimented with some file streaming.

User can add expenses and income using the python shell. Can also save or print their list of expenses/income.

Improvements:

-allow for user to type in a textbox rather than the python shell


# 4) TileMemoryGame

In this project I experimented with a timer.

This game presents you with a grid of squares and shows a pattern. You have 5 seconds to memorize it before having to replicate it yourself.

There are 3 levels. Once you complete a level you can add yourself to the leaderboard.

Improvements:

-update score for players who are already on the leaderboard when they try to save a better score
